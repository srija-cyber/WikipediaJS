- Loading spinner to indicate API fetch status

## Technologies Used

- Wikipedia API (via `https://apis.ccbp.in/wiki-search`)

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter a search term in the input field and press **Enter**.
3. The search results will be displayed below the input field.
4. Click on the titles or links to visit the respective Wikipedia pages.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Contains the structure and UI of the application.
- `script.js`: Handles the search functionality, API calls, and DOM manipulation.

```
https://apis.ccbp.in/wiki-search?search=<query>
```
where `<query>` is the user-inputted search term.
